## Channel 1: Warm Network Activation

### Step 1: Build Your Target List

Create a spreadsheet with these columns:
- Name
- Company
- Title
- Relationship (1st degree, 2nd degree, past colleague)
- ICP Fit Score (1-10)
- Last Contact Date
- Notes

**Target List Size:** 50-100 warm contacts

### Step 2: Categorize Relationships

| Category | Definition | Approach |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Inner Circle** | Would take your call today | Direct ask |
| **Warm Contacts** | Know you, positive impression | Reconnect first |
| **2nd Degree** | Connected through mutual contact | Request intro |
| **Past Clients/Colleagues** | Professional history together | Catch-up approach |

### Step 3: Outreach Templates

**Inner Circle (Direct Ask):**

```
Subject: Quick favor + exciting news

Hey [Name],

Quick update - I launched XGrowthOS, an autonomous B2B lead gen platform.
We use AI to book qualified meetings for companies like [their type].

Two asks:
1. If this sounds relevant for [Company], I'd love 15 minutes to show you
2. Any intros to [VP Sales / Growth leaders] in your network?

Currently offering Founding Partner pricing (60% off, locked for life)
to first 10 clients.

Worth a call?

Marcos
```

**Warm Contacts (Reconnect):**

```
Subject: Thinking of you + something new

Hey [Name],

Been a while! Hope things are going well at [Company].

I recently launched something I think you might find interesting -
an autonomous lead gen platform using AI to book B2B meetings.

Not a sales pitch, but curious if you know anyone struggling with
outbound who might want to chat?

And if you have 15 min to catch up regardless, I'm around.

Best,
Marcos
```

**2nd Degree (Request Intro):**

```
Subject: Quick intro request

Hey [Mutual Contact],

Hope you're well! I'm reaching out because I'm launching something
that might be relevant for [Target Name] at [Target Company].

XGrowthOS is an autonomous B2B lead gen platform - we use AI to
book qualified meetings. Given [Target Company]'s growth, thought
they might be a good fit.

Would you be comfortable making an intro? Happy to send you a
forwardable blurb if easier.

Thanks!
Marcos
```

### Step 4: Follow-Up Cadence

| Day 14 | Final touch, value-add content |

---

## Channel 2: Cold Outbound (Email)

### Email Sequence (5-Touch)

**Email 1: Pain-Focused Opener**

```
Subject: [Company] + outbound (quick q)

Hi [First Name],

Noticed [Company] is growing - congrats on [recent milestone/hiring].

Quick question: is your outbound pipeline keeping up with growth,
or are you stuck in the "SDR trap" - hiring people who spend 65%
of their time not selling?

We built XGrowthOS to fix this. 11 AI engines that work 24/7 to
book qualified meetings. Our target is 8%+ reply rates (industry
avg is 5.1%).

Worth 15 min to see if it fits?

Marcos
Founder, XGrowthOS
```

**Email 2: Social Proof (Day 3)**

```
Subject: Re: [Company] + outbound

[First Name],

Quick follow-up on this.

One thing I didn't mention: we're the only agency with a CSM
Automation Suite. That means:
- Automated weekly reports (no chasing)
- 24/7 issue detection (problems fixed before you know about them)
- Self-serve portal (answers when you need them)

Most agencies deliver leads. We deliver leads + exceptional service.

Interested in seeing how?

Marcos
```

**Email 3: Results Focus (Day 6)**

```
Subject: 27 meetings in 90 days

[First Name],

That's what we booked for [similar company/industry] in their
first quarter with us.

The secret? Continuous AI optimization. We run A/B tests every
Monday and Wednesday, not monthly like traditional agencies.

If you're evaluating outbound options, happy to show you exactly
how we'd approach [Company].

15 min - worth it?

Marcos
```

**Email 4: Risk Reversal (Day 10)**

```
Subject: If we fail, you pay nothing

[First Name],

I get it - agencies have burned you before. So here's our guarantee:

If reply rates stay below 3% for 30 days, you can terminate with
15 days notice. Pro-rated refund. Keep all the leads.

We only succeed when you do. That's why our pricing is
$2K/month + $250 per meeting booked.

Worth a conversation?

Marcos

PS - Currently have 3 Founding Partner spots left at 60% off
(locked for life).
```

**Email 5: Breakup (Day 14)**

```
Subject: Should I close your file?

[First Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

I'll stop reaching out, but if outbound becomes a priority later,
here's my calendar: [Calendly link]

We'll be here.

Marcos
```

### A/B Testing Plan

| Element | Variant A | Variant B |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Subject Line | Pain-focused | Question-based |
| Opener | Company research | Direct pitch |
| CTA | "15 min call?" | "Reply with questions" |
| PS Line | Scarcity | Social proof |

---

## Channel 3: LinkedIn Outreach

### Profile Optimization

**Headline:**
```
Founder @ XGrowthOS | Autonomous B2B Lead Gen | 11 AI Engines Book Meetings While You Sleep
```

**About Section:**
```
I help B2B companies book qualified meetings without hiring SDRs.

After seeing sales teams waste 65% of their time on non-selling
activities, I built XGrowthOS - an autonomous lead generation
platform powered by 11 AI engines.

What makes us different:
- AI-powered optimization (Mon/Wed A/B testing cycles)
- CSM Automation Suite (proactive service, not reactive support)
- Performance-aligned pricing ($250/meeting)
- 14-day launch (not 6-week onboarding)

Current offer: Founding Partner pricing (60% off, locked for life)
for our first 10 clients.

Interested? Let's chat: [Calendly link]
```

### Connection Request

```
Hi [Name] - saw we're both in the B2B growth space. I run XGrowthOS,
an autonomous lead gen platform. Always looking to connect with
[title]s who are thinking about pipeline. Open to connecting?
```

### Message Sequence (Post-Connection)

**Message 1 (Day 1):**
```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

Curious - how's outbound working for [Company] these days?
Seeing a lot of companies struggle with SDR productivity.

Not pitching, just genuinely curious what's working for you.
```

**Message 2 (Day 4, if no response):**
```
[Name] - one thing I've been thinking about:

Most agencies focus only on lead gen. We built automation for
client success too (automated reports, issue detection, self-serve portal).

If you ever want to see what that looks like in practice, happy
to do a quick walkthrough. No pressure.
```

**Message 3 (Day 7, if engaged):**
```
Happy to show you exactly how we'd approach [Company]'s ICP.

Here's my calendar if useful: [Calendly link]

If not right now, totally get it - keep me in mind for later.
```

struggling with outbound? We have 3 more Founding Partner spots

Happy to give you $500 credit for any intro that takes a call.

No pressure - just thought I'd ask since you're seeing results.

## Objection Handling

### "We've tried cold email before"

**Response:**
"Most people have - and most do it wrong. Can I ask what your reply rate was? Industry average is 5.1%. We target 8%+ through continuous AI optimization. The difference is we run A/B tests twice a week, not once a month. What specifically didn't work for you?"

### "We already have an agency"

**Response:**
"Totally fair. Out of curiosity, what are they delivering for you? ... We see companies come to us from other agencies when they're paying more for less optimization. If you're getting 8%+ reply rates and great service, stay put. But if not, might be worth comparing."

### "The pricing is high"

**Response:**
"Let me ask - what's your average deal size? ... OK, so at $[ACV], if we book 10 meetings and you close 20%, that's 2 deals = $[revenue]. Against a $4,500/month investment, that's [X]x ROI. The question isn't whether it's expensive - it's whether the return justifies it."

### "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Totally understand. Can I ask what specifically you're weighing? ... [Address concern] ... Here's what I'd suggest: the Founding Partner pricing won't last forever - we have [X] spots left. If the concern is risk, our performance guarantee means you can exit if we don't hit 3% reply rates. What would help you make a decision?"

### "Send me information"

**Response:**
"Happy to. Before I do - what specifically would be most useful? That way I can send the right stuff. ... Also, can we schedule a quick 15-min call for when you've reviewed it? Just to answer any questions."
