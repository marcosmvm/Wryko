## Executive Summary

This document defines XGrowthOS's Ideal Client Profile (ICP) in detail, going beyond the client discovery questionnaire to establish strategic targeting criteria, identify buying triggers, and prioritize market segments.

---

## ICP Summary

### Primary ICP Statement

**XGrowthOS is ideal for:**

B2B companies with **$15K-$150K ACV**, **11-500 employees**, in **technology, professional services, or business services** verticals, who have an **established product/service** but lack predictable outbound pipeline, and are **ready to invest in growth** without hiring a full SDR team.

## Firmographic Criteria

### Company Size

| Segment | Employees | Revenue | Fit Score |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Sweet Spot** | 25-150 | $5M-$50M | Excellent |
| **Good Fit** | 11-250 | $2M-$100M | Good |
| **Acceptable** | 5-500 | $1M-$200M | Acceptable |
| **Not Ideal** | <5 or >500 | <$1M or >$200M | Poor |

**Why This Range:**
- **Too Small (<10):** Can't afford $2K/month, may not have sales capacity for meetings
- **Too Large (>500):** Usually have in-house SDR teams, enterprise procurement cycles
- **Sweet Spot (25-150):** Established enough to afford and use leads, not big enough for internal team
