## Churn Prevention

### Early Warning Signs

| Signal | Risk Level | Action |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Unresponsive to emails (7+ days) | High | Call immediately |
| Skipped 2+ scheduled calls | High | Escalate to founder |
| Asked about contract terms | Medium | Proactive check-in |
| Negative feedback in survey | High | Call within 24 hours |
| Reduced engagement (no logins) | Medium | Re-engage with value |
| Asked for data export | Critical | Retention call ASAP |
| Mentioned competitor | High | Competitive response |

### Retention Playbook

**When Client Expresses Concerns:**

1. **Listen First:** Don't defend, understand
2. **Acknowledge:** "I hear you, and this is valid"
3. **Clarify:** "Help me understand specifically..."
4. **Respond:** Address each concern directly
5. **Commit:** "Here's what we'll do..."
6. **Follow Up:** Document and track

**Retention Offers (Use Sparingly):**

| Situation | Offer |
|-----------|-------|
| First-time underperformance | Free optimization sprint |
| External factors (budget cuts) | Pause with retention |
| Competitive threat | Match + extra value |
| Multiple issues | Executive attention + plan |

**When to Let Go:**

Not all clients should be retained. It's OK to part ways if:
- They're consistently abusive to team
- Expectations are unrealistic despite alignment efforts
- Product-market fit doesn't exist
- Continued service damages your reputation

## Client Communication Standards

### Response Time SLAs

| Channel | First Response | Resolution |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Slack/Chat | 2 hours | Same day |
| Email | 4 hours | 24 hours |
| Emergency | 15 minutes | 4 hours |

### Communication Tone

**Do:**
- Be proactive and transparent
- Own problems ("we" not "the system")
- Provide context and next steps
- Follow up unprompted

**Don't:**
- Make excuses
- Blame external factors
- Over-promise to calm concerns
- Ghost when things are hard

### Difficult Conversation Framework

**HEAR Method:**

1. **H**ear: Let them express fully
2. **E**mpathize: Acknowledge their feelings
3. **A**sk: Clarify what they need
4. **R**esolve: Propose specific solution
