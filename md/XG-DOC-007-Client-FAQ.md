## Troubleshooting

### Why is my reply rate low?

Common causes:
1. **ICP too narrow** - Expand targeting
2. **Messaging mismatch** - A/B test angles
3. **Timing issues** - Adjust send times
4. **List quality** - Improve data sources
5. **Market conditions** - External factors

The Scientist analyzes patterns and recommends fixes.

### Why are emails going to spam?

Possible causes:
1. **Domain warmup incomplete** - Need more time
2. **Content triggers** - Adjust copy
3. **Volume too high** - Reduce daily sends
4. **Technical issues** - Check authentication

The Guardian monitors this in real-time.

### What if a prospect complains?

- We immediately add them to DNC
- Review the interaction
- Ensure compliance
- Report to you if significant
- Spam complaints tracked (<0.1% threshold)
