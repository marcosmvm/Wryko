## Objection Response Framework

### The LAER Method

| Step | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **L**isten | Let them finish, don't interrupt | Understand fully |
| **A**cknowledge | Validate their concern | Build rapport |
| **E**xplore | Ask clarifying questions | Find root cause |
| **R**espond | Address with specifics | Provide solution |

## Category 1: Price Objections

### "It's too expensive"

**Underlying Concern:** Budget constraints or perceived value gap

**Acknowledge:**
"I hear you - $2,000/month is a real investment. Let me make sure I understand what you're comparing it to."

**Explore:**
- "What's your current spend on outbound (SDRs, tools, time)?"
- "What would 10 extra qualified meetings per month be worth to you?"
- "Have you calculated your cost per meeting today?"

**Respond:**
"Let me do the math with you. At $2,000/month plus $250/meeting, if we book 10 meetings and you close 20%, that's 2 deals. At your ACV of $[X], that's $[revenue] from a $4,500 investment. That's [X]x ROI.

Compare that to an SDR at $120K/year who might book 8-10 meetings/month. We're a fraction of the cost with better performance guarantees."

**Proof Points:**
- Industry SDR cost: $120K/year for 8-12 meetings/month
- Wryko cost: ~$54K/year for 10+ meetings/month
- Cost per meeting: $450 vs $800-1,250

### "We don't have budget right now"

**Underlying Concern:** Timing, not value

**Acknowledge:**
"Totally understand - budgets are tight everywhere. When does your next budget cycle open up?"

**Explore:**
- "Is this a 'not now' or a 'not ever'?"
- "What would need to change for this to become a priority?"
- "If you had budget, would this be something you'd do?"

**Respond (If timing issue):**
"Got it. A few options:

1. We could start with a smaller scope and expand when budget opens
2. I can follow up in [X months] when your cycle restarts
3. Some clients expense it as a marketing cost rather than sales - any flexibility there?"

**Respond (If truly no budget):**
"Understood. Let me send you some resources in the meantime. When things change, I'll be here. Is it okay if I check back in [X months]?"

---

### "Can you do it cheaper?"

**Underlying Concern:** Negotiation or genuine constraint

**Acknowledge:**
"I appreciate you asking directly. Let me be transparent about our pricing."

**Explore:**
- "What budget were you working with?"
- "What would make this a no-brainer investment?"

**Respond:**
"Our Founding Partner pricing at $2,000/month is already 60% off our standard rate. That's our best offer, and it's locked for life.

Here's why we don't go lower: our costs are real (domains, tools, AI credits, support). If we cut price, we'd have to cut service - and that hurts your results.

What I can do: if you're committed to 12 months upfront, I can waive the onboarding fee. That's $2,500 in savings."

**Hard Line:**
We don't discount below Founding Partner rates. This protects the quality of service for all clients.

---

## Category 2: Trust & Credibility Objections

### "We've tried cold email before - it doesn't work"

**Underlying Concern:** Past failure, skepticism

**Acknowledge:**
"That's actually really common. Most cold email fails because of how it's done, not because the channel doesn't work."

**Explore:**
- "What was your reply rate when you tried?"
- "How long did you run it?"
- "Who was managing the campaigns?"

**Respond:**
"Industry average reply rate is 5.1%. Most internal teams or cheap agencies get 2-3%. We target 8%+.

The difference? Continuous optimization. We run A/B tests every Monday and Wednesday - not monthly. What worked last month might not work today, so we adapt constantly.

We also have The Guardian watching deliverability 24/7. Most campaigns fail because of inbox placement issues no one catches. We catch them in hours, not weeks."

**Proof Points:**
- Industry avg: 5.1% reply rate (Belkins 2024)
- Wryko target: 8%+ reply rate
- A/B test frequency: 2x/week vs monthly

---

### "How do I know you'll deliver results?"

**Underlying Concern:** Risk, accountability

**Acknowledge:**
"That's a fair question - agencies make a lot of promises. Here's how we're different."

**Respond:**
"Three things:

1. **Performance-aligned pricing**: $250 per meeting means we only make money when you book meetings. Our incentives are aligned with yours.

2. **Performance guarantee**: If reply rate stays below 3% for 30 days, you can terminate with 15 days notice and get a pro-rated refund. Keep all the leads.

3. **Transparency**: You get a real-time dashboard, weekly automated reports, and access to all campaign data. No black boxes.

We put our money where our mouth is. If we don't perform, you don't pay."

---

### "You're a new/small company"

**Underlying Concern:** Stability, experience

**Acknowledge:**
"We are founder-led and growing - that's a fair point. Here's why I think that's actually an advantage."

**Respond:**
"A few things to consider:

1. **You get founder-level attention**. I'm personally involved in every client engagement. At a bigger agency, you're account #347.

2. **We're built on automation**. Our 11 AI engines mean we're not dependent on human headcount to deliver. The system works whether we have 5 clients or 500.

3. **Founding Partners get locked-in pricing**. You're taking a chance on us early - we reward that with 60% off forever.

4. **Performance guarantee protects you**. If we don't deliver, you can exit. No long-term lock-in.

The question isn't our size - it's whether we can deliver results. Let me show you our data."

---

### "I need to see case studies / references"

**Underlying Concern:** Social proof

**Acknowledge:**
"Absolutely - you should talk to people who've worked with us."

**Respond (If you have case studies):**
"Here are a few relevant examples:
- [Case Study 1]: {{industry}}, {{results}}
- [Case Study 2]: {{industry}}, {{results}}

I can also connect you with [Client Name] if you'd like a direct reference. They're in {{similar industry}} and have been with us for {{duration}}."

**Respond (If early stage):**
"We're in our Founding Partner phase, so our case study library is building. Here's what I can offer:

1. Our own outbound results (we practice what we preach)
2. Industry benchmark data from Belkins 2024 study
3. A 90-day pilot with performance guarantees

The Founding Partner model means we're deeply invested in your success - you're building our case studies."

---

## Category 3: Competitive Objections

### "We're already talking to [Competitor]"

**Underlying Concern:** Comparison shopping

**Acknowledge:**
"Good - you should compare options. Who else are you talking to?"

**Explore:**
- "What's most important to you in making this decision?"
- "What do you like about what they're offering?"
- "Any concerns about their approach?"

**Respond (vs. Enterprise agency like Belkins):**
"Belkins is a great company - they literally wrote the industry benchmarks. But they're also 7-10x our price.

If you have $15-25K/month and want the biggest brand name, go with them. But if you want similar results at 70% lower cost with faster onboarding, we should compare specifics.

One thing they don't have: our CSM Automation Suite. We've automated client success, not just lead gen. That means better service at lower cost."

**Respond (vs. Cheaper competitor):**
"What are they charging? ... At that price point, I'd ask a few questions:

1. What's their A/B testing cadence? (If it's monthly, your campaigns will stagnate)
2. What happens when you have a deliverability issue at 2am?
3. Do they have automated reporting, or do you chase them for updates?

We cost a bit more because we actually deliver. Our CSM Automation Suite means proactive service, not reactive support."

---

### "We already have SDRs"

**Underlying Concern:** Internal investment, territorial

**Acknowledge:**
"Perfect - we're not here to replace them. We're here to make them more productive."

**Respond:**
"Here's how we typically work with companies that have SDRs:

Your SDRs are great at:
- Warm follow-up
- Complex conversations
- Relationship building
- Closing

They're wasting time on:
- Cold prospecting
- List building
- Sequence management
- Deliverability monitoring

We handle the top of funnel, they focus on what they're best at. Most clients see SDR productivity go up 30-50% because they're not grinding on cold outreach.

Think of us as pipeline infrastructure, not headcount replacement."

---

### "We use [Instantly/Apollo/Lemlist] internally"

**Underlying Concern:** DIY preference, cost savings

**Acknowledge:**
"Those are great tools - we actually use Instantly.ai for sending ourselves."

**Explore:**
- "How's it working? What's your current reply rate?"
- "Who's managing the campaigns?"
- "How much time are you spending on it weekly?"

**Respond:**
"The tools are the easy part. The hard parts are:
- Strategy (what angle actually works?)
- Optimization (what to test, when to pivot)
- Deliverability (catching issues before they tank results)
- Scale (doing this without burning 10 hours/week)

Our clients tried DIY before coming to us. They realized their time is worth more than the $1,800/month difference. And our results are 2-3x better because we do this all day, every day.

Keep the tools if you want - we can layer on top. Or let us handle everything end-to-end."

---

## Category 4: Timing Objections

### "I need to think about it"

**Underlying Concern:** Uncertainty, need more info

**Acknowledge:**
"Totally fair - this is an important decision. Can I ask what specifically you're weighing?"

**Explore:**
- "What would help you make a decision?"
- "Is there something you're not sure about?"
- "Who else needs to be involved?"

**Respond:**
"I get it. A few things that might help:

1. Our performance guarantee means you can exit if we underperform. Low risk.

2. Founding Partner pricing won't last forever - we have [X] spots left. I don't want you to miss that if timing is the only concern.

3. I'm happy to jump on a quick call to address any specific questions.

What would make you confident enough to move forward?"

---

### "We're focused on other priorities right now"

**Underlying Concern:** Competing initiatives

**Acknowledge:**
"Makes sense - there's always a lot going on. What's taking priority?"

**Explore:**
- "When do you think pipeline will become a focus?"
- "What would need to happen for this to move up the list?"

**Respond:**
"Understood. Here's a thought: most of our clients came to us when they realized pipeline problems compound.

A slow quarter now means a slow close quarter 6 months from now. The best time to fix pipeline is before it's a crisis.

What if we started small - one campaign, one ICP - while you focus on other priorities? Minimal lift from your side, and you're building pipeline for next quarter."

---

### "Call me back in [X months]"

**Underlying Concern:** Not urgent

**Acknowledge:**
"Happy to do that. Mind if I ask why that timing?"

**Explore:**
- "What changes in [X months]?"
- "If we could show value before then, would that change things?"

**Respond:**
"I'll put it in my calendar. One thing to consider:

Cold email campaigns take 2-4 weeks to ramp. If you wait until [X months], you won't see results until [X + 2 months].

If pipeline is going to matter in Q[X], we should start now so you're ramped when you need it.

Any flexibility on that timeline?"

---

## Category 5: Decision Process Objections

### "I need to run this by my [boss/team/partner]"

**Underlying Concern:** Multiple stakeholders

**Acknowledge:**
"Of course - who else needs to be involved?"

**Explore:**
- "What will they want to know?"
- "What are their likely concerns?"
- "Would it help if I joined a call with them?"

**Respond:**
"I can help with that. A few options:

1. I'll send you a one-pager that summarizes everything for them
2. Happy to jump on a call with your [boss/team] directly
3. What questions do you think they'll have? Let me answer those now so you can address them

What would be most helpful?"

---

### "Send me information and I'll review"

**Underlying Concern:** Avoiding commitment, buying time

**Acknowledge:**
"Happy to. What specifically would be most useful for you to see?"

**Explore:**
- "What information would help you make a decision?"
- "When will you have time to review it?"

**Respond:**
"I'll send that over. Before I do - can we schedule a quick 10-minute follow-up call for after you've reviewed it?

That way I can answer any questions while it's fresh. How does [specific time] look?"

**Key:** Always schedule the follow-up before sending materials.

---

## Category 6: Technical/Service Objections

### "What about deliverability? I don't want to damage our domain"

**Underlying Concern:** Risk to reputation

**Acknowledge:**
"That's the right concern to have. Most cold email fails because of deliverability problems."

**Respond:**
"This is why we built The Guardian. It's our compliance and deliverability engine:

1. **Separate domains**: We never send from your main domain. We buy and warm dedicated sending domains.

2. **24/7 monitoring**: We check blacklists daily, track spam rates in real-time, maintain <0.1% complaint rates.

3. **Gmail/Yahoo compliance**: We handle SPF, DKIM, DMARC, one-click unsubscribe - all the 2024-2025 requirements.

4. **Automatic protection**: If something goes wrong, The Guardian catches it in hours and auto-fixes when possible.

Your main domain stays completely protected. We take all the deliverability risk."

---

### "How do you integrate with our CRM?"

**Underlying Concern:** Workflow disruption

**Respond:**
"We integrate with all major CRMs:

- **HubSpot**: Native integration, leads sync automatically
- **Salesforce**: API integration, real-time sync
- **Pipedrive**: Direct connection
- **Other**: Webhook-based integration

Here's what happens:
1. When someone books a meeting → Lead created in your CRM automatically
2. All email activity logged → You see the conversation history
3. Meeting notes synced → Your sales team has context

We configure this during onboarding. Most integrations take 30-60 minutes to set up."

---

### "What if we want to pause or cancel?"

**Underlying Concern:** Lock-in fear

**Respond:**
"We're not about lock-in. Here's the deal:

**90-day pilot**: Initial commitment to give campaigns time to work. Cold email needs runway.

**After 90 days**: 30-day rolling. You can pause or cancel anytime with 30 days notice.

**Performance guarantee**: If reply rate stays below 3% for 30 days, you can terminate with 15 days notice, pro-rated refund.

**Pause option**: Taking a month off? We can pause instead of cancel. Resume when ready.

We want clients who want to be here. No long-term contracts, no gotchas."

## Objection Prevention

### During Discovery, Proactively Address:

| Concern | Proactive Statement |
|---------|---------------------|
| Price | "Let me show you the ROI math..." |
| Past failure | "Most cold email fails for specific reasons..." |
| Timing | "Pipeline problems compound over time..." |
| Risk | "We have a performance guarantee..." |
| Credibility | "We're founder-led, which means..." |

### Qualification Questions That Surface Objections:

1. "What would need to be true for you to move forward?"
2. "What's your biggest concern about doing this?"
3. "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
4. "What's happened when you've tried this before?"
5. "What would make you say no?"

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Listen first**: Most objections have a deeper concern underneath
2. **Acknowledge before responding**: Makes them feel heard
3. **Ask questions**: Understand the real issue
4. **Use specifics**: Data and examples beat generalities
5. **Always get next steps**: Never leave a conversation open-ended
6. **Document objections**: Track patterns to improve
