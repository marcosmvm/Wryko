## Slide 2: The Problem

### B2B Sales Teams Are Drowning

**SDRs spend 65% of their time NOT selling**

| Activity | Time Spent |
|----------|------------|
| Prospecting & research | 35% |
| Data entry & admin | 20% |
| Email & follow-up | 10% |
| **Actually selling** | **35%** |

**The results?**
- $120K+ annual cost per SDR
- 5.1% average cold email reply rate
- Inconsistent pipeline
- Burnout and turnover

**Market reality:** Traditional cold outreach is broken.

|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Clients per CSM | 10-12 | **20-25** |
| Reporting time | 30-45 min/client/week | **0 min** (automated) |
| Issue detection | Reactive (hours/days) | **Proactive (minutes)** |
| Onboarding admin | 5-6 hours | **1-2 hours** |

**Impact on unit economics:**
- Lower CAC through operational efficiency
- Higher gross margins
- Faster scaling without linear headcount growth

**Defensibility:** 6 months of development + continuous improvement
