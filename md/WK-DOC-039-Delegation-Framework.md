## Executive Summary

This document defines what the founder handles vs. what is delegated to team members vs. what is automated by the 11 AI engines. It evolves as the company grows.

## Delegation Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Automate first:** If a system can do it, don't assign it to a human
2. **Delegate outcomes, not tasks:** Give ownership, not instructions
3. **Founder on highest leverage:** Focus on what only the founder can do
4. **Document before delegating:** SOPs exist before handoff
5. **Trust but verify:** Check outcomes, not methods
