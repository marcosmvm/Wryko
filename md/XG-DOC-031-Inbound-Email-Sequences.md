## Sequence 2: Content Download (Lead Magnet)

**Trigger:** Prospect downloads content (guide, checklist, template)
**Goal:** Nurture with value, convert to discovery call

### Email 1: Delivery + Introduction (Immediate)

```
Subject: Your {{content_name}} is ready

Hi {{first_name}},

Here's the {{content_name}} you requested:

[DOWNLOAD BUTTON: Get Your {{content_name}}]

Quick intro: I'm Marcos, founder of XGrowthOS. We help B2B
companies book qualified meetings through AI-powered cold email.

If you're downloading this, you're probably thinking about
outbound. I'll share some insights over the next few days
that might help.

Talk soon,

Marcos
Founder, XGrowthOS

P.S. Any questions about the {{content_name}}? Just reply -
I read every email.
```

### Email 2: Problem Awareness (Day 2)

```
Subject: The $120K SDR problem

{{first_name}},

Here's a stat that keeps sales leaders up at night:

SDRs spend 65% of their time NOT selling.

- 35% on prospecting & research
- 20% on data entry & admin
- 10% on email & follow-up
- Only 35% actually selling

At $85K salary + $15K tools + $20K overhead = $120K/year...
for someone who's selling less than half the time.

That's the math that led us to build XGrowthOS.

Instead of hiring humans to do repetitive tasks, we built
11 AI engines that work 24/7:

- The Guardian (compliance & deliverability)
- The Architect (AI campaign creation)
- The Scientist (continuous A/B testing)
- The Hunter (lead expansion from wins)
- The Sentinel (website visitor intelligence)
- ...and 6 more for client success automation

The result? Enterprise-level outbound at a fraction of the cost.

Worth a conversation?

### Email 3: Social Proof (Day 4)

```
Subject: 27 meetings in 90 days

{{first_name}},

Quick case study:

A SaaS company came to us with a problem: their 2-person
SDR team was burning out and only booking 5-6 meetings/month.

After 90 days with XGrowthOS:
- 27 qualified meetings booked
- 42% open rate (industry avg: 27.7%)
- 8.5% reply rate (industry avg: 5.1%)
- 3 deals closed ($180K pipeline)

The difference? Continuous AI optimization.

Most agencies set up campaigns and check in monthly. We run
A/B tests every Monday and Wednesday. What's working today
might not work next week - so we adapt constantly.

If you want similar results, let's talk.

```

### Email 4: Differentiation (Day 7)

```
Subject: What makes us different (honest answer)

{{first_name}},

You've probably seen a dozen cold email agencies. Here's
what actually makes us different:

1. **CSM Automation Suite**
   Most agencies are 100% focused on lead gen. We built 6
   engines to automate client success too. Result: better
   service at lower cost.

2. **Performance-Aligned Pricing**
   $2,000/month + $250 per meeting. We only make money
   when you book meetings. No more paying for promises.

3. **14-Day Launch**
   Traditional agencies take 4-6 weeks. We launch in 14
   days through automation.

4. **Continuous Optimization**
   Mon/Wed A/B testing cycles, not monthly reviews.

Not right for everyone. We work best with:
- B2B companies ($15K+ ACV)
- Defined target market
- Sales team ready to take meetings
- 90-day commitment mindset

Sound like you? Let's talk.

### Email 5: Final Offer (Day 10)

```
Subject: Last one from me

{{first_name}},

I've sent a few emails - want to respect your inbox.

If outbound lead gen isn't a priority right now, no worries.
I'll stop here.

But if you're still thinking about it, here's my offer:

15-minute call. I'll show you exactly how we'd approach
your ICP. No pitch unless you want one. If it's not a fit,
I'll tell you.

[CTA: Grab 15 Minutes]

If not now, I'll check back in a few months.

Best,

Marcos

P.S. We have {{remaining_spots}} Founding Partner spots left
at 60% off (locked for life). Just FYI.

## Sequence 3: Referral Introduction

**Trigger:** Referred by existing client or partner
**Goal:** Leverage warm introduction for fast conversion

### Email 1: Warm Introduction (Immediate)

```
Subject: {{referrer_name}} thought we should connect

Hi {{first_name}},

{{referrer_name}} suggested I reach out - mentioned you might
be looking at ways to improve your outbound pipeline.

Quick context: I'm Marcos, founder of XGrowthOS. We help B2B
companies book qualified meetings through AI-powered cold email.
{{referrer_name}}'s team has been with us for {{duration}} and
we've booked {{meetings_count}} meetings for them.

Not sure if what we do is relevant for {{company}}, but
{{referrer_name}} thought it might be worth a quick chat.

Would you have 15 minutes this week?

Marcos

[CTA: Pick a Time]
```

### Email 2: Value Add (Day 3)

```
Subject: Something that might help

{{first_name}},

Following up on my note - I know you're busy.

Thought I'd share something useful regardless:

[LINK: Cold Email Deliverability Checklist for 2026]

Gmail and Yahoo changed their rules in 2024-2025. A lot of
companies are seeing deliverability tank without knowing why.
This checklist covers the essentials.

Let me know if a quick call would be helpful.

Marcos
```

### Email 3: Case Study (Day 6)

```
Subject: How {{similar_company}} books 12 meetings/month

{{first_name}},

Quick case study from a company similar to {{company}}:

{{similar_company}} ({{industry}}, {{size}} employees) was
struggling with inconsistent outbound results. Their in-house
efforts were getting 3-4% reply rates.

After switching to XGrowthOS:
- Reply rate: 9.2%
- Meetings/month: 12 (up from 4)
- ROI: 18x on monthly investment

Happy to show you how we'd approach {{company}}'s ICP.

Marcos

[CTA: Book a Call]
```

### Email 4: Direct Ask (Day 10)

```
Subject: Worth a call?

{{first_name}},

I'll keep this short.

{{referrer_name}} thought we could help {{company}} book more
qualified meetings. I'd love to show you how in 15 minutes.

If it's not a fit, I'll tell you honestly.

[CTA: Let's Talk]

If the timing isn't right, just let me know - happy to
reconnect down the road.

Marcos
```

## Sequence 4: Re-Engagement (Cold Lead Revival)

**Trigger:** Lead went cold 30-90 days ago
**Goal:** Reignite interest with fresh angle

### Email 1: Pattern Interrupt (Day 1)

```
Subject: We spoke {{time_ago}} ago

Hi {{first_name}},

We chatted about outbound lead gen back in {{month}} -
timing wasn't right then.

Wanted to circle back because:

1. We've added 6 new AI engines for client success
   (not just lead gen anymore)
2. Founding Partner pricing is almost gone (3 spots left)
3. We've booked {{total_meetings}} meetings in the last 90 days

Any of that change the calculus for you?

Marcos
```

### Email 2: New Development (Day 4)

```
Subject: Something new since we talked

{{first_name}},

One thing that's changed since we last connected:

We launched our CSM Automation Suite - 6 AI engines that
handle client success. Things like:

- Automated weekly reports (The Informant)
- 24/7 issue detection (The Judge)
- Self-serve client portal (The Navigator)

Why does this matter to you? It means better service at
the same price. Most agencies are reactive. We're proactive.

Worth revisiting the conversation?

Marcos

[CTA: Quick Chat?]
```

### Email 3: Last Touch (Day 8)

```
Subject: Should I check back later?

{{first_name}},

Wanted to give this one more try.

If outbound isn't a priority for {{company}} right now,
totally get it. Just let me know and I'll follow up in
a few months.

But if things have changed and pipeline is on your mind,
I'm around:

[CTA: Book 15 Minutes]

Either way, wishing you a strong {{quarter}}.

## Sequence 5: Post-Demo No Decision

**Trigger:** Had discovery call but didn't close
**Goal:** Overcome hesitation, convert to customer

### Email 1: Recap + Address Concerns (Day 1)

```
Subject: Following up on our call

Hi {{first_name}},

Thanks for the conversation yesterday. Good to learn more
about {{company}}'s goals.

Quick recap of what we discussed:

- Your target: {{meeting_goal}} meetings/month
- Your ICP: {{icp_summary}}
- Main concern: {{main_objection}}

On that last point - totally fair concern. Here's how we
address it:

{{objection_response}}

I've attached the proposal we discussed. Happy to answer
any questions.

Marcos

[ATTACHMENT: XGrowthOS Proposal - {{company}}]
```

### Email 2: Case Study Match (Day 3)

```
Subject: Company just like yours

{{first_name}},

Thought this might help with your decision:

{{similar_company}} ({{industry}}, {{size}} employees) had
the same concern you mentioned: {{main_objection}}.

Here's what happened:
- Started with 90-day pilot
- Booked {{meetings}} meetings in first quarter
- Now in month {{tenure}} with us

Happy to connect you with their team if helpful.

Let me know if you have questions about moving forward.

Marcos
```

### Email 3: Urgency (Day 6)

```
Subject: Quick update on Founding Partner spots

{{first_name}},

Wanted to let you know: we're down to {{remaining_spots}}
Founding Partner spots.

Reminder of what that means for you:
- $2,000/month instead of $4,000 (60% off)
- $250/meeting instead of $350
- Rate locked for life

Not trying to pressure you - just want to make sure you
have the info if timing is a factor.

Any questions holding you back?

Marcos
```

### Email 4: Final Decision Request (Day 10)

```
Subject: Decision time?

{{first_name}},

I want to respect your time, so I'll be direct:

Are you ready to move forward with XGrowthOS?

If yes: Reply and I'll send the agreement today.

If no: No hard feelings. Let me know what changed and
we can revisit down the road.

If maybe: Tell me what's holding you back. Happy to
address any concerns.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Marcos
