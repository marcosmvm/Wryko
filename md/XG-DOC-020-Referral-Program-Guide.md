## Frequently Asked Questions

### When do I receive my credit?

Credits are applied to your next invoice after the referral completes their discovery call.

### Can I earn multiple credits?

Yes! There's no limit to how many referrals you can make. Each qualified referral = $500 credit.

### What if my referral doesn't become a client?

You still receive the credit! They just need to complete a discovery call.

### Can I refer someone I barely know?

We recommend warm introductions. Cold referrals rarely result in discovery calls and won't qualify.

### What if someone I referred comes back later?

If they complete a discovery call within 90 days of your referral, you receive credit. After 90 days, the referral expires.

### Can I refer another company I own?

No, self-referrals (including companies you own or are a major stakeholder in) are not eligible.
