|---------|--------|--------|
| **First Meeting Booked** | Within 24 hours | Slack/email celebration + ask |
| **10 Meetings Milestone** | At milestone | Personal call |
| **End of Pilot (90 days)** | Day 85 | Formal request |

**Avoid Asking:**
- Clients with ongoing issues

---

## Collection Process

### Step 1: Identify Candidates

**Weekly Review (Friday):**
1. Pull NPS scores from past 2 weeks
2. Review meeting milestones
3. Check for positive Slack/email comments
4. Note any referrals made
5. Add qualified candidates to Testimonial_Pipeline

### Step 2: Warm-Up

Before asking for a testimonial, ensure:
- Recent positive interaction
- No open support issues
- Results are strong
- Relationship is solid

### Step 3: Make the Ask

**Email Template (Written Testimonial):**

```
Subject: Quick favor? (2 minutes)

Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to reach out because you've been seeing great results -
{{meetings}} meetings in {{duration}}. That's awesome!

Quick favor: Would you mind sharing a brief testimonial about
your experience with XGrowthOS? Just 2-3 sentences is perfect.

A few questions to spark ideas:
- What problem were you trying to solve?
- What results have you seen?
- What's been your favorite part of working with us?

Happy to draft something based on our conversations if that's
easier - you can just approve/edit.

Either way, thanks for being a great client!

Marcos
```

**Email Template (Video Testimonial):**

```
Subject: Would you share your story? (15 min)

Hi {{first_name}},

I have a special request - and totally fine to say no.

Your results with XGrowthOS have been exceptional:
- {{meetings}} meetings booked
- {{reply_rate}}% reply rate
- {{outcome}} achieved

Would you be open to recording a quick video testimonial?
It would help other companies like {{company}} understand
what's possible.

Here's what it involves:
- 15-minute Zoom call (I'll guide the conversation)
- 5-6 questions about your experience
- We handle all editing

As a thank you, I'd be happy to [offer: credit, gift, etc.].

No pressure at all - let me know what you think.

Marcos
```

**In-Person Ask (Best for Video):**

"Hey [Name], I have to say - your results have been fantastic. [Specific numbers]. Would you be willing to share that story in a quick video? It would really help other [industry] companies see what's possible. I can make it super easy - just a 15-minute call where I guide the conversation."

### Step 4: Capture

6. Recommendation (2 min)

Questions to Ask:
1. "Tell me about {{company}} and what you do."
2. "What was happening with your outbound before XGrowthOS?"
3. "What made you decide to try us?"
4. "What results have you seen?"
5. "What's surprised you most about working with us?"
