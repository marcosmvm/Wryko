### Slide 2: The Problem

**Your Sales Team is Stuck in the Cold Outreach Trap**

- ❌ SDRs spend 65% of time on non-selling activities
- ❌ Generic templates get ignored (5.1% industry avg reply rate)
- ❌ Manual processes don't scale
- ❌ Deliverability issues kill campaigns
- ❌ No time for optimization

**Result:** Inconsistent pipeline, missed targets, frustrated teams.

### Slide 3: The Hidden Costs

**What Manual Outreach Really Costs You:**

| Traditional Approach | True Cost |
|----------------------|-----------|
| 1 SDR salary + benefits | $85,000/year |
| Tools & data | $15,000/year |
| Management overhead | $20,000/year |
| **Total** | **$120,000/year** |
| **Meetings booked** | 8-12/month |
| **Cost per meeting** | $800-1,250 |

*And that's if they perform well.*

3. What's your current outbound doing?

**Questions for Us?**

---

## Presenter Notes

### Discovery Questions to Ask

1. "Walk me through your current outbound process."
2. "How many SDRs are focused on cold outreach?"
3. "What's your target for meetings booked per month?"
4. "What's your average deal size?"
5. "Have you tried cold email before? What happened?"
6. "What would 20 extra qualified meetings per quarter do for your business?"

### Objection Handling

**"We've tried cold email, it doesn't work."**
> "What was your reply rate? Industry average is 5.1%. Most teams use templates without optimization. Our AI runs A/B tests every Monday and Wednesday, continuously improving. We target 8%+ reply rates."

**"We already have SDRs."**
> "Perfect - we augment your team, not replace them. Your SDRs focus on warm leads and follow-up while we fill the top of funnel. Most clients see their SDRs become more productive."

**"What about deliverability?"**
> "The Guardian monitors 24/7. We check blacklists daily, maintain <0.1% spam rates, and handle all Gmail/Yahoo compliance. You never wake up to a domain on a blacklist."

**"The pricing seems high."**
> "Let's do the math. At $2,000/month plus $250/meeting, if we book 10 meetings and you close 20%, that's 2 deals. At $30K ACV, that's $60K from a $4,500 investment. 13x ROI."
