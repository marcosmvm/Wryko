**What's In It For You:**
- **$500 credit** for each qualified referral
- Credits applied to your next invoice
- No limit on referrals

**How It Works:**
1. Reply with their name, company, and email

3. When they sign, you get $500 credit

Warm introductions work best, but cold referrals are welcome too.

Thanks for thinking of us!
