## Forwardable Email Templates

### Template 1: General Introduction

**Subject Line Options:**
- "You should talk to Marcos about outbound"
- "This is the lead gen company I mentioned"
- "Thought of you - outbound lead gen"

**Email Body:**

```
Hey [Name],

I wanted to connect you with Marcos Matthews at Wryko.

We've been using them for [X months] to handle our cold email
outreach. The results have been solid:

• [X] qualified meetings booked
• [X]% reply rate (way above industry average)
• Their AI engines actually optimize campaigns automatically

What I like:
- They only charge for meetings ($250 each), so incentives are aligned
- Automated weekly reports (I don't have to chase for updates)
- 11 AI engines that handle everything

Might be worth a conversation if outbound is on your radar.

[Your Name]

P.S. They're still offering Founding Partner pricing (60% off,
locked for life). Not sure how much longer that lasts.
```

### Template 2: Problem-Specific (SDR Pain)

**Subject:** "How we replaced our SDR struggle"

```
[Name],

Remember when we were talking about SDR challenges? I found
something that's been working for us.

Wryko - it's an autonomous lead gen platform. Basically,
11 AI engines that do what an SDR team would, but consistently.

We were spending $120K+/year on SDRs and getting 5-6 meetings/month.
Now we're at [X] meetings/month for about $4-5K total.

The founder, Marcos, is great to work with. Here's his calendar
if you want to explore: [calendly link]

Worth 15 minutes to see if it could work for you.

[Your Name]
```

### Template 3: Results-Focused

**Subject:** "[X] meetings in [Y] months"

```
[Name],

Just wanted to share something that's been working for us.

We started using Wryko for cold email outreach [X months] ago.
Since then:

• [X] qualified meetings booked
• [X]% reply rate (they target 8%+)
• Zero deliverability issues (they have 24/7 monitoring)

The big difference is they use AI to optimize campaigns constantly -
like A/B testing twice a week, not once a month.

If outbound lead gen is something you're thinking about, I'd
recommend talking to them.

Here's the founder's calendar: [calendly link]

Let me know if you want me to make an intro directly.

[Your Name]
```

### Template 4: The Warm Introduction

**Subject:** "Intro: [Referrer] <> [Prospect] (Wryko)"

```
Moving to BCC after intro.

[Prospect] - meet Marcos, founder of Wryko. We've been
working with his team on cold email outreach and the results
have been great.

Marcos - [Prospect] leads [role] at [Company]. They're
[context about their situation].

I'll let you two take it from here!

[Referrer Name]
```

## One-Pager for Referrers

### Quick Reference Card

**What We Do:**
Autonomous B2B lead generation. 11 AI engines that book qualified
meetings through cold email.

**Who We're Best For:**
- B2B companies with $15K+ average deal size
- Sales teams that need more meetings
- Companies tired of SDR turnover
- Anyone who's tried cold email and it didn't work

**What's Different:**
1. AI that actually optimizes (Mon/Wed testing, not monthly)
2. $250/meeting = aligned incentives
3. Automated reporting & 24/7 monitoring
4. 14-day launch, not 6-week onboarding

**Results:**
- 8%+ reply rates (industry avg: 5.1%)
- 40%+ open rates
- Typical: 8-15 meetings/month

**Pricing (Founding Partner):**
- $2,500 one-time onboarding
- $2,000/month retainer
- $250/qualified meeting
- 60% off forever (locked)

**How to Refer:**
Forward this email or send them here: wryko.com/book-demo

**Referral Credit:**
$500 credit per qualified referral (they just need to complete
a discovery call).

## Talking Points

### When Someone Asks "What Do They Do?"

> "They handle cold email outreach - but with AI automation.
> So instead of hiring SDRs or using a traditional agency,
> they have these 11 AI engines that run campaigns, optimize
> them automatically, and book meetings. The cool part is they
> only charge $250 per meeting, so they're incentivized to
> actually deliver."

### When Someone Asks "Is It Expensive?"

> "It's about $4-5K/month total for us (retainer plus meeting
> fees). Way cheaper than an SDR, and more consistent. Plus
> they have this Founding Partner deal where you get 60% off
> forever if you sign up now."

### When Someone Asks "Does It Work?"

> "For us, yes. We've gotten [X] meetings in [Y] months.
> Our reply rate is [X]% which is apparently way above
> industry average. The main thing is they actually optimize -
> like testing subject lines twice a week, not just setting
> and forgetting."

### When Someone Asks "What's the Catch?"

> "You need to be able to take meetings and close them.
> They handle top of funnel, you handle the rest. Also
> it takes like 2-4 weeks to see results since campaigns
> need time to ramp."

## Referral Program Reminder

### How It Works

1. You refer someone to Wryko
2. They complete a discovery call
3. You get $500 credit on your next invoice

### What Counts

- Referral must complete discovery call (not just schedule)
- Must be a new prospect (not already in our pipeline)
- No limit on referrals

### What Doesn't Count

- Your own company (obviously)
- Someone we've already contacted
- No-shows to discovery calls
