## The Challenge

### Before Wryko

The company had grown to $3M ARR primarily through inbound marketing and founder-led sales. As they pushed toward Series A, they needed predictable outbound pipeline but struggled to scale.

**Pain Points:**
- SDR team of 2 booking only 6-8 meetings/month combined
- Cold email campaigns averaging 3.2% reply rate
- High CAC ($12,000+) making outbound unprofitable
- Founders spending 15+ hours/week on prospecting
- Deliverability issues causing emails to land in spam

**Previous Approaches:**
- In-house SDR team (2 reps, $140K/year fully loaded)
- Traditional lead gen agency ($5K/month, 3-month contract)
- DIY using Outreach.io and ZoomInfo

**Why Those Failed:**
The SDR team struggled with consistent messaging and couldn't A/B test fast enough. The agency used generic templates and bulk sending, damaging domain reputation. DIY tools required too much founder time to manage effectively.

Week 1:
- Discovery call to define ICP: VP/Director of Operations at companies 500-5000 employees
- Analyzed 47 current customers to identify patterns
- Built targeting criteria: Operations/Process titles at manufacturing, logistics, and financial services companies

Week 2:

- Client approved copy with adjustments to pain point messaging
- 6 domains configured and warmup initiated

Weeks 3-4:
- Campaigns launched across all 6 domains
- The Scientist began A/B testing cycle (Mon/Wed)
- First meetings booked by Day 11

**AI Engines Activated:**

| Architect | Generated 12 sequence variations, iterating on persona-specific messaging |
| Scientist | Ran 24 A/B tests, improving reply rate from 4.1% to 9.2% |

## Key Optimizations

### What The Scientist Discovered

**A/B Test Wins:**

| Test | Finding | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| Subject Lines | Question-based outperformed statements by 23% | +8% opens |
| Opening Hook | Specific pain point > generic intro | +34% replies |
| CTA | "Quick question" > "15-minute call" | +18% conversion |
| Send Time | Tuesday 10:30 AM ET optimal | +12% engagement |

**Iteration Journey:**

- Version 1.0 (Week 1-2): 4.1% reply rate
- Version 1.1 (Week 3-4): 6.3% reply rate (+54%)
- Version 1.2 (Week 5-6): 7.8% reply rate (+24%)
- Version 1.3 (Week 7-8): 9.2% reply rate (+18%)
- Final Version: 9.2% reply rate (124% improvement from start)

**Key Discovery:**
The Scientist identified that mentioning "manual approval workflows" in the subject line increased open rates by 31% for manufacturing prospects specifically. This insight was applied across campaigns, creating persona-specific variants.

## Client Testimonial

> "We tried building an outbound motion for 18 months with mixed results. Within 90 days with Wryko, we booked more meetings than our SDR team did in a full year. The AI optimization is real - we watched our reply rates climb from 4% to over 9% as the system learned what worked. We're now projecting $2M+ in pipeline for next year from this channel alone."

## The Hunter in Action

**Lead Expansion Results:**

When positive replies came in, The Hunter automatically:

- Identified 127 additional contacts at responding companies
- Found 89 lookalike companies matching their profile
- Generated 216 new qualified leads

**Expansion Metrics:**
- Positive replies received: 38
- Colleagues identified: 127 (3.3 per reply avg)
- Lookalike companies found: 89
- Additional meetings from expansion: 11 (29% of total)

**Notable Win:**
A positive reply from a Director of Operations triggered The Hunter to identify the VP of Operations and CFO at the same company. Multi-threading led to a $95K deal that closed in 47 days.

## Why It Worked

### Success Factors

1. **Precise ICP Definition**
   The discovery process identified that manufacturing companies with 500-2000 employees had the shortest sales cycles and highest close rates. Focusing here first accelerated results.

2. **Continuous Optimization**
   The Scientist's twice-weekly A/B testing created 24 experiments over 90 days. Each test improved targeting, messaging, or timing incrementally.

3. **Compliance & Deliverability**
   The Guardian's domain rotation and real-time monitoring maintained 99.2% inbox placement, compared to 71% before Wryko.

4. **Client Collaboration**
   Weekly calls allowed quick feedback on lead quality, enabling ICP refinement. The client's willingness to share closed-won customer data improved targeting accuracy.

### ROI Calculation

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total Investment | $10,000 (setup + 90-day costs) |
| Revenue Generated | $340,000 ARR |
| First-Year Value | $84,800 (at 25% 1st-year realization) |
| **ROI** | **847%** |

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI Optimization Compounds** - The 124% reply rate improvement came from continuous small wins, not one big change. Each A/B test contributed incrementally.

2. **Multi-Threading Accelerates Deals** - The Hunter's automatic expansion led to 29% of meetings, and multi-threaded deals closed 34% faster.

3. **Deliverability is Foundation** - The client's previous 71% inbox placement was destroying ROI. Achieving 99%+ was the foundation for all other improvements.
